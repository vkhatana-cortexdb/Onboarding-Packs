# CortexDB — Self-Hosted Trial Bundle

Everything needed to stand up a local [CortexDB](https://cortexdb.ai) instance for a
trial — a memory + knowledge layer with document/image/audio/video ingestion, source
connectors, a code-intelligence plane, and an MCP server for AI tools.

Designed to be followed by a **person** or handed to a **coding agent**.

## What's in this bundle

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| **`CORTEXDB_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** | The step-by-step guide. Start here. |
| **`cortex.example.env`** | Env template for the CortexDB server container. Copy to `cortex.env` and fill in your key. |
| **`README.md`** | This file. |

Keep the two content files **together** — the guide references the env template.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** (Docker Desktop or Engine) running.
- An **OpenAI API key** — powers the LLM (answers/reasoning) and image/audio ingestion.
  *(Optional if you use the fully-local fallback in the guide, where answer quality is lower.)*
- **Python 3.11+** — only needed for the connectors, SDK, or CLIs (not for the core server).
- ~6 GB free disk for the container images + the local embedding model.

## Quick start (do it yourself)

Open **`CORTEXDB_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** and follow it top to bottom. The short path to a working
instance is §1–§6:

1. Create the Docker network
2. Start Ollama + pull the embedding model
3. Start Tika
4. `cp cortex.example.env cortex.env` and paste in your OpenAI key
5. Start the CortexDB container
6. Health check + a test write/read

Optional add-ons (do only what you need): §7 media, §8 connectors, §9 code plane &
enrichment, §10 MCP server, §11 Python SDK & CLI.

## Hand it to an AI agent

The guide has a **"Using this guide with an AI agent"** preamble at the top. To kick it off,
put both files where the agent can read them and give it this prompt:

```text
Follow CORTEXDB_SETUP_GUIDE.md to stand up CortexDB locally, step by step.
Docker is running. When you reach the env step, create cortex.env from
cortex.example.env but STOP and ask me to paste the OpenAI key myself — do not put
it in chat. Same for any connector tokens. Run each section, verify with the checks
in the guide, and tell me if anything fails.
```

Works with any file-aware coding agent — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and others. In Claude
Code you can point at the file with `@CORTEXDB_SETUP_GUIDE.md`.

**The agent handles everything except the secrets** — you paste the OpenAI key and any
connector tokens yourself; the agent should never print or commit them.

## Security

- **Never share a filled-in `cortex.env`** — it contains a live OpenAI key. Share
  `cortex.example.env` (placeholders only). Add `cortex.env` to `.gitignore`.
- Use **throwaway/revocable tokens** for connectors, scoped to test data.
- Local-mode auth is a fixed placeholder token — **do not expose port `3141`** to the
  public internet.

## What you get once it's running

- **Write & recall** memories over an HTTP API (`:3141`), with a built-in Admin UI at `/`.
- **Media ingestion** — PDFs/Office (Tika), images (vision), audio/video (Whisper).
- **Connectors** — Slack, Jira, GitHub, Notion, and ~14 more sources.
- **Code plane** — index repositories and query cited code context.
- **MCP server** — expose CortexDB as a memory layer to Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex,
  Cursor, and other MCP clients.
- **SDK & CLI** — drive it from Python or the terminal.

See the guide for details, verification steps, and troubleshooting.
